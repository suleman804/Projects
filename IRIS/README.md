# IRIS
## Project Motivation
#### In this project I have classified three class of iris flower. The iris dataset is a simple and beginner-friendly dataset that contains information about the flower petal and sepal sizes. The dataset has 3 classes with 50 instances in each class, therefore, it contains 150 rows with only 4 columns
## Summery of project 
In this project I have classify three classes of iris flower according to the features and these are 
##### 1. sepal length
##### 2. sepal width 
##### 3. petal length
##### 4. petal width
And three labels are there 
##### 1. setosa 
##### 2. versicolor
##### 3. verginica
In this project I have used dataset from sklearn.datasets import load_iris .
Split it into 70% training set and 30% test set.
I have used logistic regression in it.
I have found my model 95% accurate on it.

## Data 
Iris dataset has 150 examples, four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and 3 class lables (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
